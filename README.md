# pathfinding
C++ implementation of some pathfinding algorithms

## Usage

	pathFinding [--algorithm=<algorithm>] [--output=<file>] FILE

## Algorithms
- Dijkstra

## TODO
- [x] Write read_map for input of type map.
- [x] Write build_graph for input of type map.
- [ ] Output of dijkstra, not straight to stdout.
- [ ] Verify there's only one Start Node and End Node in the input map.
- [ ] Refactor UNCROSSABLE_NODE as a dictionary.
